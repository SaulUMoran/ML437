	Github: https://github.com/SaulUMoran/ML437.git

To run the following COLAB notebooks: 

	/Final_species-classification.ipynb 
		+ contains pipeline methods for vector standardization 

	/Comparing_SVM_models.ipynb
		+ contains several SVM implementations, SVC(), NuSVC(), SVC(kernel = 'linear'), LinearSVC()
		+ contains pipeline methods for vector standardization

	/species-classification.ipynb  
		+ does not contain pipeline methods for vector standardization

1. Run Colab notebook. 

2. Will be asked to upload ‘kaggle.json’ file

3. This file is located in project folder in Google Drive

4. Download file and upload to notebook when asked

5. The SVM model will run.

NOTE: Model takes more than an hour to finish running and display performance accuracies.

An overview of the architecture used in training our SVMs can be found in our Write up found here or in the project folder:
